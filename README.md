This project was developed to manage equipment, not only in stock, but also to know how many are active, inactive, at the customer's disposal, with technicians, and also in stock.
It has a tracking view where you can search by the equipment's MAC address or serial number and easily see the entire trajectory of the equipment, as well as the reasons for the movements and the people responsible for them.
